# Dart Money

A small web-site to host a list of portfolio equities and current valuations,
using the free stock quotes API from Alpha Vantage. This project is being done
primarily as an exercise in learning Golang-based server development and the
Gin web framework. The client-side code is prosaic, but may be expanded and/or
improved after numerous parts of the server are more finished.
