# Dart Money

A small web-site to host a list of portfolio equities and current valuations,
using the free stock quotes API from Alpha Vantage. This project is being done
primarily as an exercise in learning Golang-based server development and the
Gin web framework. The client-side code is prosaic, but may be expanded and/or
improved after numerous parts of the server are more finished.

The project name is a reference to the old finance scenario of investors
picking stocks by throwing darts at a board of stock listings.

NOTE: to run this server, you must have an equity quotes API key (it's free)
from Alpha Vantage - get it from https://www.alphavantage.co.
